# Web Project 2
## By Trista Runions

### Project Description

This is the second web project I have done for Yandex. In this project, I added some animations and videos along with a few information blocks where I got to practice my positioning skills. 

### Technologies and Techniques used

I used Visual Studio Code to write this project. I used techniques like at-rules to create the animations, pseudo rules to create the opacity in the links and flex layouts for positioning. This project also uses the BEM file structure.

### Plans for Finalizing the Project
I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned!
