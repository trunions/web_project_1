# Web Project 2
## By Trista Runions

### Project Description

This is the second web project I have done for Yandex. In this project, I added some animations and videos along with a few information blocks where I got to practice my positioning skills. 

### Technologies and Techniques used

I used Visual Studio Code to write this project. I used techniques like at-rules to create the animations, pseudo rules to create the opacity in the links and flex layouts for positioning. This project also uses the BEM file structure.

### Plans for Finalizing the Project
I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned! 

Recent code review fixes:
1. I did a little HTML cleanup and changed some tags to more appropriate ones. 
2. I removed two different background images and added them with CSS stylings. 
3. I used HTML entities to replace the arrows in a few links.
4. Did some repositioning in the Khan block.
5. Fixed the links for a smoother transition when hovered over. Also fixed the links in the footer. 
6. Cleaned up and got rid of unnessacery CSS.
